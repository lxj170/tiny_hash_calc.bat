# tiny_hash_calc.bat
This is a very, very small hash value calculation software. It is actually just a script that uses Microsoft's own software. When I wanted to calculate the hash value, I downloaded the software, but it was reported as a virus, and I didn't want to compile the open source program from github. So I wrote it and debugged it.

The program is very simple to use. You can directly drag files into the program's icon and calculate the MD5 hash value and SHA1 hash value. Or you run the bat program, enter the path of the file to be calculated or drag the file to the cursor.
